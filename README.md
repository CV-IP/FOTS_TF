# FOTS_TF
## This an implementation of [FOTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01671) with tensorflow
### The code is based on the [EAST](https://github.com/argman/EAST). Thanks for the author
#### More information will commit soon
#### Code is still going on. If you find bugs or problems, please start an issue and let me know. Thanks!
## How to use
#### I think tensorflow version >= 1.0 and python2 will work
#### 1) Change the data path in icdar.py and eval.py
#### 2) Run multigpu_train.py for training or eval.py for testing
